Whenever Gordon came on screen, you knew it was going to be an incredible episode! His and Dale's chemistry was incredible and so fun to see on screen. Love Gordon a little more in season 2, perhaps because he appears more and has way more cutie pie moments! AND I LOVE HOW EVERYTIME HE COMES ON SCREEN HE SPEAKS LIKE THISSSSS!!!
