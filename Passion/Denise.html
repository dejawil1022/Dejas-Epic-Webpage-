<img src="Images2/Denise2.jpg" Style="width:400px;height:550px"/><p style=color:white>Denise comes on for literally less than 3 episode in the entire season but I don’t care she changed my life. I tell everyone to watch Twin Peaks, and not just because of the storyline and the absurdity, but also for the Denise reveal, god I love Denise. Worked with Dale Cooper in the past as an Agent and comes to the town of Twin Peaks to also help solve the case of who killed Laura Palmer (just incase you forgot). Denise is beautiful, and a ray of light in this damned god foresaken town! I love Denise and i’m pretty sure the everyone else does as well, in just 3 episodes she has changed the whole world of twin peaks. I give her a solid 20 red lipstick applications out of 10</p>
