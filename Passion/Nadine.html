<h1 style=color:white>Nadine</h1>

<img src="Images2/Nadine2.jpg" Style="width:400px;height:550px"/><p style=color:white>You know what, I actually liked Nadine. Many may be shocked by this fact, or not shocked i’m not sure i’m not frequent in the Twin Peaks fandom, but she brought so much light and humor to the show, especially in season 2! Did I groan everytime she appeared on screen in season 2? Yes absolutely, but I believe she was what was needed to give a little light and humor into season 2 of the show, though still slightly annoying, I don’t think I would give Nadine a low rating. 3 eyepatches out of 10! (now you maybe like “oh damn! You said you wouldn’t give her a low score!” Trust me it could be lower…but there some weird charm about Nadine I can’t exactly put my finger on) </p>
