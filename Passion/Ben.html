<h1 style=color:white>Ben Horne</h1>

<img src="Images2/Ben2.jpg" Style="width:500px;height:600px"/> <p style=color:white>Ben is an absolute freak-a-tron. Ben is the father of Audrey Horne, whom I will get to in a bit. There are no words to describe Ben Horne. He’s so interesting at the start of the show but then the second season hits, and it's like an absolute snoozefest! Many might find him interesting but truly, he’s only so interesting when his brother, Jerry Horne (yes, like Ben and Jerry’s), comes onto the screen with him. A bit of a spoiler if you care, but Ben and Jerry are the only two in the show that get an outro screen and replace Laura! Ridiculous! And I hate him for that! So altogether Ben gets 3 cigars out of 10 as his rating.
