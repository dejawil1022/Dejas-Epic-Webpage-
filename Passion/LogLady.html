<h1 style=color:white>Log Lady</h1>
<img src="Images2/Loglady2.jpg" Style="width:400px;height:575px"/><p style=color:white>While famously called log lady, I do believe she has a name in the show, though not used by many of the characters. I don’t really have an incredible mindblowing opinion on her, but I do believe she is a one of a kind character! Really adds nothing to the show (many would disagree with me here and perhaps fight me on this, but this is my passion project so  I don’t give a damn!)  yet I can’t seem to imagine the show without her. Every halloween I see at least one log lady, so it’s good to see that the love of twin peaks is still in the hearts of many. Rating: 7 logs out of 10</p>
