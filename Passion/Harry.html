<h1 style=color:white>Officer Harry</h1>

<img src="Images2/Harry2.jpg" Style="width:500px;height:650px"/><p style=color:white>Dale’s partner in crime and the head officer in the town of twin peaks! (and possibly gay lover heh heh heh) I mean come on if this show had taken place in todays time do you know how many wlw and mlm relationships would be in the show! An insane amount! But that’s not what we’re discussing. Harry was chill and one of the only “normal” people in Twin Peaks (besides Ed of course). Viscouisly loyal to Josie which I actually appreciated (oh and did I mention that EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE is cheating on eachother in twin peaks? The plot is insane) Harry got shit done at the end of the day and you know what I really appreciate that! Harry’s rating is going to be a solid….8 sheriff badges out of 10. (and i know people are going to be really defensive on this because Harry truly is 2 dimensional, but I don’t care! So is a lot of people’s favorites! Moving on!)
