<h1 style=color:white>Pete</h1>

<img src="Images2/Pete2.jpg" Style="width:400px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>Pete gets complicated….Pete is the husband of Catherine who runs the sawmill that Josie (remeber her?) tookover after Josie’s husband died who was Catherines brother! (Twin Peaks gets extremely complicated at times, I have tried to spare you all from it). Oh Pete, I will never be able to form an opinion on you. At first a sweet old man, kinda in some messy stuff (mostly because of Catherine), but mostly keeps to himself and isn’t all that smart. In season two he becomes way more evil for some reason?? And (poorly) plays both sides in the Catherine and Josie feud which is ridiculous seeing that (spoiler alert!) CATHERINE MAKES JOSIE HER SLAVE IN THE HOUSE THEY ALL SHARE!!! AND HE CONSTANTLY LAUGHS AT JOSIE’S EXPENSE! Hate the guy in season 2 love him in season 1. God Catherine if you only stayed dead! (and you’re probably asking why Catherine isn’t on this list, Catherine is a freak who I try to pretend doesn’t exist along with Leo, I despise them both, unsure if its at the same caliber as Donna and James thought) Petes rating is going to be 3 fish in the percaltors out of 10
