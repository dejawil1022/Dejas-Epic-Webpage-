<img src="Images2/Laura4.jpg" Style="width:400px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>The reason why the show even exists! The most beautiful woman to ever exist ever. I mean that. The purity of Laura was corrupted by the people who surrounded her. The movie does an incredible job of portraying her as the person she was before she was killed and how her traumas played into her lifestyle and death! There may be only one person who killed Laura, but everyone killed her in one way or another! LONG LIVE LAURA PALMER! Rating: 10 lipstick-stained cigarettes out of 10!</p>
