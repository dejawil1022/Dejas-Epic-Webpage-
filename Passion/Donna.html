<img src="Images2/Donna2.jpg" Style="width:450px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>You see how everyone on this list so far has a high rating? Well, SPOILER ALERT, not Donna. A wanna-be Laura Palmer and a fake friend! Every time she came on screen with her stupid boyfriend James, I wanted to scream! In season 2, they, for some reason, tried to up her sex appeal, which made her an even worse character than before somehow. Hey girl, the thing to say after your “best friend” dies is “I will always miss her,” not “I feel like I'm living in the best dream and my worst nightmare” after taking her side man! AND SOMEHOW THE MOVIE PORTRAYS HER BETTER! THEY COULD NEVER MAKE ME HATE YOU, RECAST DONNA! Rating: 3 stolen sunglasses out of 10
