<img src="Images2/Albert2.jpg" Style="width:450px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>Last but not least, probably one of the top 3 characters of all time in the world of Twin Peaks, Albert! Albert once upon a time worked with Dale in the FBI alongside another very prominent case that appears in the show, and visits the town of Twin Peaks to help Dale solve the murder of the show. Now I know Iâ€™ve said this alot about quite a few characters on this list, but when Albert came on the screen, that's how you KNEW that the episode was gonna be good. I love Albert and his no bullshit Attitude! Because at the end of the day, he got shit DONE! He lowkey might be my number one favorite (I KNOW WHAT I SAID ABOUT DENISE BUT IM HUMAN PEOPLE IM ALLOWED TO CHANGE! (Denise will always be number 1 in my heart)). I love you and your bald head, Albert, and for that, Albert gets an incredible rating of 10 bitch slaps from Harry Truman out of 10!</p>
