Dale is beloved by basically all of the fandom, including me (but not beloved by everyone in the town of Twin Peaks!). At times in my mind, especially today, I mix him up in my mind with David Byrne, who has nothing to do with Twin Peaks. No one else could play this role better than Kyle McLaughlin, I swear by it! (or Kale as the late and great director, David Lynch, would call him) So baby girl, in the first season, a little less in the second, but heâ€™s overall perfect to me. Rating: 10 damn good fine cups of coffee out of 10.  </p>
