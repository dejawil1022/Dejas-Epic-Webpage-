<img src="Images2/Ed2.jpg" Style="width:450px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>ED!! Oh how I loved Ed! So kind and compassionate. Whenever he came on screen it felt like a safeguard, like being wrapped in a big blanket and being told “hey it’s okay, unclench your jaw and rest your shoulders, a real man has appeared on screen!” In both seasons his character remains quite the same which I appreciate! Unlike DONNA (who not only changed in season two but changed in the movie! I’m still not over that! They can never make me form an opinion on you Donna!) While season two ends in a cliff hanger and the shows 25 year old revival Twin Peaks: The Return doesnt exist to me, I do hope that Ed and Norma eventually got to run away together, get married, and live happily ever as they both deserve! I love Ed, Ed forever and ever and ever and ever. Rating: 10 big ed’s gas farms out of 10! </p>
