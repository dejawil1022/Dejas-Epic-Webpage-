<img src="Images2/Hawk2.jpg" Style="width:450px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>HAWK!!! Oh Hawk how I love you so, also somewhat of a one dimensional character but also very dynamic, oh how I wish he was utilized more. Hawk works along side Harry and Dale and the Twin peaks police department and does a damn fine job! Hawk is underrated asf and I feel as if very few people will say he’s their favorite but god damnit i’m gonna say hes mine! Hawk has always been and always be for the people! Long live Hawk! And long live America! Hawk’s rating is going to be 10 feather earrings out of 10</p>
