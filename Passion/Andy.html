<p style=color:white>Andy….oh Andy….I love you so! Andy is an officer that too works alongside the other officers at the Twin Peaks Police Department, At first I despised the man, you’re a police officer how are you gonna cry over a dead body! MAN UP! But then something changed, once you realize that Andy is just a big ol’ sweetheart (and kind of stupid), you kinda change your mind fairly quickly, I love Andy, another one of my favorites and probably quite a few others favorites as well *cue simulation swarm by big thief* (those who know, know). I hope he’s happy forever and ever and nothing ever corrupts him in this world. Andy’s rating for today is going to be 10 wood planks out of 10! </p>
