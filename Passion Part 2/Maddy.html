Isn’t that just Laura Palmer in a weird curly wig?” and to that I say yes! It is! And yes it is strange! But it’s also kinda awesome? Maddy also gets corrupted by the people of Twin Peaks, in a similar way that Laura does, its so evil! Love Maddy to bits and pieces, not my favorite but definitely added spice to the show in a spectacular way. Rating: 9 bad curly brown wigs out of 10 </p>
