<img src="Images2/Josie2.jpg" Style="width:500px;height:650px"/><p style=color:white>While saving her in my files, I couldn’t remember her name, and still even right before I started writing about her, I couldn’t remember her name! Not saying she has zero relevance to the show, but definitely not all that striking at times! Her face card is definitely one of the few things saving her from getting a low rating on this list. But in all honesty, she has just as complicated of a background as Laura! Josie and Harry’s relationship was definitely interesting and for once, I was actually rooting for them! They treated Josie so evily when it came to season 2! Never did she get a day of rest, oh well, Josie you are loved by many but me not included. Rating: 4 random flights to seattle out of 10. </p>
