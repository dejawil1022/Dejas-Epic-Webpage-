<img src="Images2/Lucy .jpg" Style="width:390px;height:600px"/><p style=color:white>Oh Lucy, so much to say….Lucy also works in the Twin Peak Police Department as a receptionist, but from time to time works with the officers to help them solve something with the case. Lucy also is dating Andy! Lucy in season one was my everything. I think at one point I wanted to be her! She’s just so cute and innocent and overall a very fun and refreshing character in twin peaks. She’s there to remind you that there are “good” people in the town of Twin Peaks! Season two on the other hand…well she’s not exactly my favorite, she becomes slightly evil especially towards Andy which I am not fond of at the slightest! Her innocence slighty wears off and she becomes a little bit insufferable, but not so much so as DONNA AND JAMES! (I DESPISE THOSE TWO I DONT CARE!!!!) my final rating for Lucy today is going to be 8 cute fuzzy sweaters out of 10 (might get a lot of backlash on this one, but I don’t care!)  </p>
