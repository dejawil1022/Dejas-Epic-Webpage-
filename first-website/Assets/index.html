        <p>Hello World!! Hi Hi Hi!</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">hand</a> has become <i>increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. </i> <em> Most websites today are built from templates on website-building platforms, and the knowledge of how to make a website from scratch is relegated to a select few. </em> has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the perceived requirements and expectations for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by <b>developing an understanding of the best practices</b>, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space. </p>

        <p> this is a list of things to do while screaming! </p>
       <ul>
        <li> punch a wall </li>
        <li> eat your grandma </li>
        <li> throw pennies at unsuspecting strangers </li>
       </ul>
       <p> this is the same list but put in a more silly order</p>
        <ol>
        <li> punch a wall </li>
        <li> eat your grandma </li>
        <li> throw pennies at unsuspecting strangers </li>
       </ol>
